each time a process opens, creates, or deletes a file, tests are performed by the kernel

	1. If the effective user ID of the process is 0 (the superuser), access is allowed. This gives the superuser free rein throughout the entire file system.

	2. If the effective user ID of the process equals the owner ID of the file (i.e., the process owns the file), access is allowed if the appropriate user access permission bit is set. Otherwise, permission is denied

	By appropriate access permission bit, we mean that 
	if the process is opening the file for reading, the user-read bit must be on. 
	If the process is opening the file for writing, the user-write bit must be on. 
	If the process is executing the file, the user-execute bit must be on.

	3. If the effective group ID of the process or one of the supplementary group IDs of the process equals the group ID of the file, access is allowed if the appropriate group access permission bit is set. Otherwise permission is denied.

	4. If the appropriate other access permission bit is set, access is allowed. Otherwise, permission is denied.

if the process owns the file (step 2), access is granted or denied based only on the user access permissions; the group permissions are never looked at.

Similarly, if the process does not own the file but belongs to an appropriate group, access is granted or denied based only on the group access permissions; the other permissions are not looked at.
