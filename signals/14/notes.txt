sigaction() is the more advanced form of the signal() system call

Like signal(), sigaction() allows the programmer to specify a signal handler for a given signal, but it also enables the programmer to retrieve additional information about the signaling process and set additional flags and etc.

The declaration of sigaction() is as follows:

int sigaction(int signum, const struct sigaction *act,
                   struct sigaction *oldact);

First Argument: Signal to be handled

second and third arguments are references to a struct sigaction

struct sigaction {
  void     (*sa_handler)(int);
  void     (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *);
  sigset_t   sa_mask;
  int        sa_flags;
};

The first two fields, sa_handler and sa_sigaction are function references to signal handlers; sa_handler has the same type as the handlers we've been using previously
