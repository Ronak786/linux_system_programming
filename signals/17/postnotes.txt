The program runs for only 1 second, and that is because sleep() is not reentrant. It cannot be restarted after a signal handler. This is just a singular example, but there are other system calls that meet these conditions, some you might also use, like send() and recv() for network socket programming, and understanding the properties of reentrant system calls is important to becoming an effective systems programmer.
