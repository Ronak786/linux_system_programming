Process Termination
==========================

There are eight ways for a process to terminate.

Normal termination occurs in five ways:

	1. Return from main
	2. Calling exit
	3. Calling _exit or _Exit
	4. Return of the last thread from its start routine
	5. Calling pthread_exit from the last thread

Abnormal termination occurs in three ways
	6. Calling abort
	7. Receipt of a signal
	8. Response of the last thread to a cancellation request


#include <stdlib.h>
void exit(int status);
void _Exit(int status);
#include <unistd.h>
void _exit(int status);

_exit and _Exit, which return to the kernel immediately,

exit, which performs certain cleanup processing and then returns to the kernel.
