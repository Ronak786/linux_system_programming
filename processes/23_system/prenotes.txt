system:
------
syntax:
int system(const char* cmd);

system() is used to invoke an o.s cmd from c/c++ program.

Using system(), we can execute any command that can be run on the terminal.

Return value:
0  : success.
-1  : Error


The system call will fork, execute the command passed by parameter and the original parent process will wait for this to finish. This also means that system is a blocking call: The parent process can't continue until the process started by system exits. This may or may not be useful.
