As we can see from the above listing, when the previous chunk has been free'd, the malloc chunk's first 8 bytes contain the size of the previous unallocated chunk. 

So the correct representation of a malloc chunk is the following

0x10 bytes
===========================
--------------------------------
length of     | length of |
previous 	  |  current  |  Memory to be used by 
chunk if      |  chunk    |  user
unallocated   |           |
