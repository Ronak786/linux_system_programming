What is Virtual Memory
==========================

In computing, virtual memory is a memory management technique that is implemented using both hardware and software.

Addresses used by program are virtual addresses which are converted to physical addresses using Memory Management Unit (MMU)(Hardware)

Benefits of Virtual Memory
============================

freeing applications from having to manage a shared memory space, 
increased security due to memory isolation,
being able to conceptually use more memory than might be physically available, using the technique of paging

Key Points of Virtual Memory
=============================

Each process has its own virtual memory

The amount of virtual memory depends on your system's architecture

Each OS handles virtual memory differently, but for most modern operating systems, the virtual memory of a process looks like this:

	high address|-------------------| command-line arguments
   				|-------------------| and environment variables
				|        stack      |
				|-------------------|
				|					|
				|					|
				|					|
				|-------------------|
				|		heap		|
				|-------------------|
				|uninitialized data | initialized to
				|		(bss)		| zero by exec
				|-------------------|
				| initialized data  | read from
				|-------------------| program file 
				|		text		| by exec
	low address |-------------------|
			Typical memory arrangement

High Memory Addresses : Command Line Arguments + Environmental Variables + Stack Growing downwards
Low Memory Addresses:  Heap Growing Upwards + Executable

The heap is a portion of memory that is dynamically allocated (i.e. containing memory allocated using malloc).
