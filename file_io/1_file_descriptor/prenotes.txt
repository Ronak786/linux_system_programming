To the kernel, all open files are referred to by file descriptors.

A file descriptor is a non-negative integer.

When we open an existing file or create a new file, the kernel returns a file descriptor to the process

When we want to read or write a file, we identify the file with the file descriptor that was returned by open or creat as an argument to either read or write.

By convention, UNIX System shells associate 
	file descriptor 0 with the standard input of a process, 
	file descriptor 1 with the standard output, and 
	file descriptor 2 with the standard error.

Although their values are standardized by POSIX.1

the magic numbers 0, 1, and 2 should be replaced in POSIX-compliant applications with the symbolic constants
STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO to improve readability.

These constants are defined in the <unistd.h> header.
